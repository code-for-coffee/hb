1. About this release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.2 Beta is the first ready-for-all beta of the Hailboards system.  It
requires a functional phpBB based board to be installed before use.  It
includes a Snowboards style usercolors system, and a Watched Users List
that is improved of the Snowboards style.  Many of the phpBB features
remain (and will remain) in place, simply because they improve upon the
board overall, when compared to stock Snowboards, or its clone Discoboards.

	a. Click on "set default style"
	b. Set default style to HBWinter.


4. How to set a User's colors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
User colors are stored in the same table as user ranks/titles.  To change
ones' user colors, you will need to bestow a rank on them, and set a CSS
style between the open/close tags.  

These are only available in HBWinter by default, and the 
/templates/admin.css file will need to be linked to any subSilver or 
other templates in order for them to be displayed.  It is suggested to use 
this method to display usercolors (examples are stored in the stock
admin.css file).

Setting rank:
Open Tag: <span class="myusername">
Close Tag: </span>

You can also use <font> or <span style>, but they are not recommended.


5. Credits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zerosleep for the original Snowboards.

Switchblade's GCBoards/SBBoards, and Prappl's Discoboards influenced the
CSS layout/structure in Hailboards, so they deserve props.
